## Description
Vector network analyzers (VNA) designed to measure the characteristics of the signal transmission through the testing device or device under test (DUT), as well as the characteristics of the signal reflection from its ports. Such characteristics called S-parameters. Each of these parameters contains the frequency and phase responses of the DUT in the appropriate direction. The main task of VNAâ€™s is to measure the characteristics of passive and active devices, such as antennas, attenuators, filters, etc. Basic view of devices is shown on figure 1.

### Block Diagram

The diagram of the prototype of the network vector analyzer shown in the figure 2. The prototype based on the DE10-NANO development board with a connected high speed AD/DA daughter card. Circulator and lock-in amplifier was designed by our team and manufactured on a separate printed circuit board (electric circuit represented in the figures 3 and 4)
